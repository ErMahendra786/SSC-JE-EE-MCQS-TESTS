      "question": "A 3-phase transformer has a delta-connected primary and star-connected secondary with a turns ratio of 2:1. If primary voltage is 400 V, the secondary line voltage is:",
      "options": {
        "A": "100 V",
        "B": "115.5 V",
        "C": "200 V",
        "D": "346.4 V"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Phase voltage ratio = 2:1. Secondary phase voltage = 400/2 = 200 V. Star line voltage = 200 × √3 ≈ **115.5 V**."

        "C": "Both AC and DC",
        "D": "Pulsed DC only"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Universal motors work on **both AC/DC** due to series-wound construction (field & armature in series)."

      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Magnetizing current ∝ air gap length. Doubling the gap **quadruples** the current (Iₘ ∝ Bₚ × δ, where Bₚ is flux density)."
