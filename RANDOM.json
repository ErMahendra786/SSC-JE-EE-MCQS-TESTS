        "Low-Pass Filter",
        "High-Pass Filter",
        "Band-Pass Filter",
        "Notch Filter"
      ],
      "answer": 0,
      "explanation": "This circuit allows low frequencies to pass through while attenuating high frequencies, hence it is a low-pass filter."

      ],
      "answer": 1,
      "explanation": "The gate shown is a NAND gate, which is an AND gate followed by a NOT gate. It outputs 0 only when both inputs are 1."
