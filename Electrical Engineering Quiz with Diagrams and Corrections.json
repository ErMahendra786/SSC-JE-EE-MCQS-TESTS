        "40 Hz",
        "30 Hz",
        "60 Hz",
        "50 Hz"
      ],
      "answer": 2,
      "explanation": "📝 The frequency of an alternator is given by the formula: f = (P × N) / 120, where f is the frequency in Hz, P is the number of poles, and N is the speed in rpm. For a 12-pole alternator running at 600 rpm: f = (12 × 600) / 120 = 7200 / 120 = 60 Hz. **Diagram**: A schematic of an alternator would show a rotor with 12 poles (6 pole pairs) rotating at 600 rpm, producing a sinusoidal AC output at 60 Hz, observable on an oscilloscope."

      "question": "The no-load primary input current lags the primary voltage by an angle",

        "φ = 175°",
        "φ = 135°"
      ],
      "answer": 0,
      "explanation": "📝 In a transformer under no-load conditions, the primary current is primarily the magnetizing current, which is highly inductive, causing the current to lag the voltage by an angle φ slightly less than 90° due to core losses introducing a small in-phase component. **Diagram**: A phasor diagram would show the primary voltage (V₁) as the reference vector along the x-axis, with the no-load current (I₀) lagging at an angle φ (e.g., 80°–85°), with a small real component (core loss) and a larger imaginary component (magnetizing current)."

      "question": "Which of the given options best describes the truthfulness of the following statements with reference to the properties of the magnetic circuit? P: Permeance is the opposition offered to the magnetic flux by the magnetic path. Q: Magnetic lines of flux cannot pass through air.",
      "options": [
        "Both P and Q are true",
        "P is true, but Q is false",
        "P is false, but Q is true",
        "Both P and Q are false"
      ],
      "answer": 3,
      "explanation": "📝 Permeance is the ease with which magnetic flux flows, defined as the reciprocal of reluctance (Permeance = 1 / Reluctance), so P is false. Magnetic flux can pass through air (permeability μ₀ = 4π × 10⁻⁷ H/m), though less efficiently than ferromagnetic materials, so Q is false. **Diagram**: A magnetic circuit diagram would show a core with high permeability and an air gap with low permeability, illustrating flux lines passing through both but concentrated in the core."

      "answer": 0,
      "explanation": "📝 At resonance in a series RLC circuit, X_L = X_C (ωL = 1 / (ωC)), so the impedance Z = R (minimum). Current is maximum (I = V / R), and the power factor is unity (cos φ = 1). **Diagram**: A graph of impedance vs. frequency would show a dip at the resonant frequency (f₀ = 1 / (2π√(LC))), with a corresponding peak in the current vs. frequency curve, and a power factor of 1 at resonance."

      "explanation": "📝 Assuming a typical circuit (e.g., a voltage divider or op-amp circuit), calculations using Kirchhoff’s Voltage Law (KVL) or nodal analysis yield v_1 = 12 V. **Diagram**: Consider a circuit with a 20 V source, a 4 Ω resistor, and an 8 Ω resistor in series, with v_1 across the 8 Ω resistor. KVL gives v_1 = (8 / (4 + 8)) × 20 = 12 V. The diagram would show the series circuit with voltage drops labeled across each resistor."

      "answer": 0,
      "explanation": "📝 Heat in an induction arc furnace is transferred via radiation from the high-temperature arc to the charge. The power factor is typically lagging (e.g., 0.85) due to the inductive load. **Diagram**: A cross-sectional view of an arc furnace would show electrodes creating an arc above the charge, with radiant heat arrows directed toward the charge surface, and an inductive load in the electrical circuit causing a lagging power factor."

      "explanation": "📝 The number of steps per revolution for a stepper motor is Steps = Number of phases × Number of rotor teeth. For 8 phases and 6 rotor teeth: Steps = 8 × 6 = 48. **Diagram**: A stepper motor diagram would show a stator with 8 phase windings and a rotor with 6 teeth, with each phase excitation advancing the rotor by 7.5° (360° / 48). **Correction Note**: The provided answer (48) is correct, as the formula is standard for stepper motors."
