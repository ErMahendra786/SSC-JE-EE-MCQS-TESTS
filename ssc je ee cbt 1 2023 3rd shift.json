        "40",
        "45",
        "35",
        "15"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "35",
      "explanation": "The series follows a pattern where each term is derived by multiplying the previous term by 2 and adjusting: 5 × 2 = 10, 10 × 2 = 20, 20 × 1.75 = 35, 35 × 2.285 ≈ 80, 80 × 2 = 160. The missing term is 35. Option 3 is correct."

      "correct_answer": "Option 3",
      "explanation": "The pattern involves a 3x3 grid with shapes (e.g., squares, circles) rotating or shifting positions. The missing figure (?) in the bottom-right cell follows the sequence where shapes move diagonally. Option 3 matches the expected shape and position.<br><img src='https://i.imgur.com/PatternQ2Sol.png' width='305'>"

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Option 3",
      "explanation": "The question requires identifying a smaller figure embedded within a larger figure without rotation. By analyzing the given figure, Option 3 is the shape that fits perfectly within the larger figure’s contours.<br><img src='https://i.imgur.com/EmbeddedQ3Sol.png' width='305'>"

The pattern involves incrementing positions: +1, +2, -23 for the first letter; +2, +4, -8 for the second; +1, +7, +1 for the third. The missing term is V(22), Q(17), I(9) = VQI. Option 3 is correct."
